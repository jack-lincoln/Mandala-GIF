# Mandala-GIF
Mandala-GIF creates a GIF of a mandala-like design using Pillow. The design does not allow for much alteration by the user.  
The program first creates individual PNG frames, each a slight alteration of the last. 
Then each image file is used to create a GIF file. 
Lastly, the image files are deleted.
