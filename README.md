# Mandala-GIF
Mandala-GIF creates a GIF of a mandala-like design using Pillow. The design does not allow for much alteration by the user.  
First, the program creates individual PNG frames, each a slight alteration of the last. 
Then each image file is used to create a GIF file. 
Lastly, the image files are deleted. 

This is the first frame of the gif. The program will create PNG files that are 1600x1600.
This image has been scaled down to 1040x1040.
